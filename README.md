Fact Sheet

HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/ behavior (JavaScript).

The code given to me was about Password checking and it gave me some time to think about how password is the basic form of protection that has become a norm, which everyone takes for granted. 

With this project I hope to help people with making up passwords that are better and stronger so that people can use their electronic devices feeely.
1. My Password checker checks for the perfect combination of letters and numbers.
2. Having Capital letters and Small letters mixed together makes them harder crack.
3. Putting in special characters also makes them hard to crack.
4. Putting a good definition of why password is important will make people think about protecting their device more.
